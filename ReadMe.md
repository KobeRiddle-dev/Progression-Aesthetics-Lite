# Progression: Aesthetics Lite

Integrates furniture mods into Vanilla progression.

Now made lite by Kobe Riddle, without any dependence on prop mods.\
The mod now mostly gets rid of extra categories, moving things to furniture, and other patches to make things cohesive.

See the original [Progression: Aesthetics](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3294950875) for a full list of changes (and ignore anything involving prop categories, naturally).

Prop mods are obviously not supported by this mod.
